# TodoMVC - Vanilla JavaScript

## Overview

This project is a clone of the TodoMVC application, implemented using vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates how to build a Todo application from scratch using plain JavaScript, without relying on any frameworks or libraries.

This implementation is based on the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) project, which provides a consistent example of how to implement a todo application in various JavaScript frameworks. This version showcases the use of pure JavaScript to manage state and handle user interactions.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Todos**: Manage your tasks with basic CRUD operations.
- **Mark Todos as Completed**: Easily toggle tasks between completed and pending states.
- **Filter Todos**: View all, active, or completed tasks using filter options.
- **Persistent Storage**: Todos are stored in `localStorage`, ensuring data persistence across page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Raman0925/Todo-MVC.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

3. **Open the project in your browser:**

    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can also use a local server for a more robust development environment:

  
## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Add a New Todo**: Enter a task into the input field and press Enter to add it to the list.
- **Edit a Todo**: Double-click on the todo text to enter edit mode and update the task.
- **Delete a Todo**: Click the delete button (usually a "×" icon) next to the todo item to remove it.
- **Mark Todos as Completed**: Click the checkbox next to a todo to mark it as completed.
- **Filter Todos**: Use the filter buttons (All, Active, Completed) to view tasks based on their status.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file defining the structure of the application.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file used for styling the application.
- `script.js` - The JavaScript file containing the core logic of the todo application.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For the application logic and interactivity.
